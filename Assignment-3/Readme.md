# First Task
string is an anagram of another if the second string is simply a scrambled version of the first. Write a python program to implement the following game: 
a)	Reads in a file that has words and their meanings in a text file. An example “words and their meanings” file is given in Canvas (i.e., mywords.txt). Note that your program needs to ask the user for the “words and their meanings” file to use. 
b)	The words and their meanings text file is of the csv (comma separated values) format. Use either notepad++ or notepad to create your file in the same format as the mywords.txt file given to you in Canvas. 
c)	Your program should then pick a word from the “words and their meanings” file, scramble the letters, and ask the user to unscramble it. Every run of your program should pick a word at random. 
d)	The user may type in the unscrambled word or may ask for the definition/meaning of the word by entering a question mark. The game continues until the user says “no” to the question: “Do you want to continue?”. 


# Second Task
The file restaurant_reviews.txt is given to you. 
 
The file contains names of reviewers and their reviews of different restaurants in the comma separated format. The first string is the name of the reviewer followed by a name of a restaurant and its rating. You are required to write a Python program that computes a similarity score between any two reviewers using Euclidean distances
