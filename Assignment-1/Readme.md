# first Task
Implement a program that requests three strings from the user. Your program should concatenate the first two strings (string1 + string2) and compare the concatenated string with the third string. If they are equal, your program should print “The two strings are equal”, otherwise, the program should concatenate the two strings in the reverse order (string2 + string1) and compare it with the third string and print “The two strings are equal”. If this second test also fails, your program should print “The two strings are not equal

# Second task
Write a Python program that reads in 3 integers or 4 integers (user first determines 3 or 4 integers) and displays the following: 
a.	the average of the numbers (two decimal places suggested) 
b.	the maximum of the numbers 
c.	the minimum of the numbers 
d.	the median of the numbers. Note that if there was 2 numbers that qualify for the median, you will calculate and display the mean of the 2 numbers 


# Third task
Write a python program that requests a positive integer from the user, determines if it is a prime, composite or neither prime or composite and prints the message

# Fourth Task
Write a program that takes as input two opposite corners of a rectangle: (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) – float or integer only. Finally, the user is prompted for the coordinates of a third point (x,y). The program should print Boolean value True or False based on whether the point (x,y) lies within the rectangle. At the end of each run, the users should be prompted to ask whether they want to continue
